# Contributing
I am no python dev, so am well aware the whole code base probably needs
cleaning up. Feel free to help out with PRs, issues etc.

### Libraries used
This application leans heavily on [GitPython](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython)
and [Asciimatics](https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics).

### Tests
The models are currently unit tested, but the views currently need a bit
of love on the testing front.
